# Linters_for_JSON

This is a linters built to flag errors in JSON files. It checks for the use of appropriate indentation, correct use of spaces after colon, the use of new lines after square and after curly brackets,and for proper use of spacing after colon.Where these rules are properly adhered to, the application will print "No errors found", otherwise the application prints the lines with errors.

# Development Milestones

- Milestone 1: Project setup was performed as described in the requirements.
- Milestone 2: Created the `bin/main.rb` file for the JSON Linters project.
- Milestone 3: Added the linters rules in the file `lib/rules.rb`following the tenets of OOP.
- Milestone 4: Run Rspec test.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Git flow
- GitHub

### Prerequisites

- Terminal (Bash)
- Git
- Ruby (with colorize gem)

### Setup: How to use the JSON Linters

- clone my repo: `git clone https://github.com/Chike1990/linters_test`
- cd into: `cd linters_test/bin`
- run `main.rb`

### How this JSON linters works:

This linters checks for errors in JSON files. The things it checks are listed and explained below:

- first_line_rule:

The first line is expected to start with a curly brace as shown in the image below. Where this expectation is not met, error message will be displayed for the first line.

- after_colon:

  A new line is expected after a comma and where it is omitted, the application flags error on that line.

  A new line with two indentation is expected after square brackets. Otherwise, error message will be printed for the line(s) affected.
